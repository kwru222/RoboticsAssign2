This repository was created as a collaboration between Keith Russell, Samrat Pravin Patel and Ruchik Mishra.

### Derivations
The "LaGrange By Hand" File is an attempt to derive LaGrangian equations of motion from a dynamics based approach.

The "Langrange Jacobian" File is an attempt to derive LaGrangian equations of motion using the techniques discussed in Robotics (DH convention).

### Code
* download both m files into a common directory
* Run runfile.m and input desired joint variable values

### Aknowldgements
We would like to aknowledge Dr. Poonawala, who assisted in our understanding of the derivation of Lagrangian dynamics, as well as Pouya Samanipour for help in creating the matlab files.
